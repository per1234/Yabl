 * The `Button` class is the main class and represents a physical button
 * attached to the board. It subclasses Bounce and therefore all public Bounce
 * methods such as `attach(...)` and `interval()` are available to the user of
 * this class. `read()`, `fell()` and `rose()` are also available but the
 * methods `down()`, `pressed()` and `released()` are preferred as they are more
 * meaningful when describing a button state or event.
 * 
 * Example of use:
 *
 *   Button button;
 *
 *   // Specify the pin the button is attached to using the `Bounce` method
 *   //`attach(...):
 *   void setup() {
 *     button.attach(6, INPUT_PULLUP); // button attached to pin 6 and ground
 *   }
 *
 *   // respond to button events in the main loop
 *   void loop() {
 *     button.update(); // update button state 
 *     if (button.pressed()) {
 *       // respond to button press here...
 *     }
 *   }
